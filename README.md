# wdi-project-2

Welcome to **"Paws and Play"**. Third project for *WDI-LONDON*
A hosted version is found [here] (https://paws-and-play.herokuapp.com/). The code can be viewed [here] (https://github.com/hassanisk/wdi-group-3).


##Introduction
This project was set to challenge us to work on a whole project with a small team. In addition, we were asked to architect, design, and collaboratively build an API of our own design.

##How to use the app

This is the home page. The navigation bar exists on any page to facilitate navigation. The *logo* on the left is reponsive and will take the user back to the home page once clicked. On the right, *log in* and *register* options. The title has "popcorn" as gif to ressemble the popping popcorn. Once the user hover around the page, images of famous movies characters will appear to add interactivity with the user.

###Planning
<img width="550" alt="screen shot 2017-03-21 at 15 34 30" src="http://i.imgur.com/PQYBafZ.png">
Using [trello.com] (https://www.trello.com]/), I created a scheduale with tasks to help me with the flow of the project with clear objectives and goals to achieve under timeframes and deadlines.
###Wireframing
<img width="550" alt="screen shot 2017-03-21 at 15 34 30" src="http://i.imgur.com/5R5ArSO.png">
Using [balsamiq.com] (https://www.balsamiq.com/), I created some wireframes to plan and decide on the layout, nagivation and the ideal user interface 

##Further Work
I would like to include more features especially for the users. A user profile page includes profile photo, status, comments, and favourites with an option of adding other users to a friend list.
